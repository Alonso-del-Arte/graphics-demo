# Graphics Demo

WORK IN PROGRESS

For a Medium article to demonstrate the basics of GUI programming from the Java 
perspective. I'll be sure to put the link here.

The idea is that this will be a very simple program that draws a bunch of trees 
near a shore and allows the user to move trees around. I haven't yet decided 
what the default number of trees will be.

This project is for Java 21, with the test dependencies being TestNG 6.14.3 and 
TestFrame 1.01.
